# feedback

Standing on the shoulders of giants, this is a great idea stolen with pride from [Phil Haack](https://github.com/Haacked/feedback) who apparently was inspired by  [holman/feedback](https://github.com/holman/feedback). Thanks!

I like to talk about software, agile, open source, beer, .NET, and other random
topics at [jayturpin.com](http://jayturpin.com/).

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as
[creating a new issue](https://github.com/haacked/feedback/issues/new) on this
project.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the
issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry- if you have any further
questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to
ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

### Read some questions

Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/turp/feedback/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=closed&page=1)
filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try
to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig
into some of the older threads.
